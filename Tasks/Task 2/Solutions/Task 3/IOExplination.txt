How I/O can be handled by polling (wait loops) or by using interrupts and why interrupt driven mechanisms allow for more efficient use of a computer system?

Interrupt Method:
• Send a character
• Repeat
	• test TTY’s “done” flag
• Until flag is set (signifying that last character printed)

Details:
Polling - the CPU asking every peripheral if they need anything over and over again
Interrupts - when the CPU goes on with work, devices send signals when they need something
